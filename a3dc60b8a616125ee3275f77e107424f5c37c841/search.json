Chris S. Hallett Hall (2012) experimentally tested efficiency large (102 m) small (21 m) seine nets used last 40 years Peel-Harvey caught different guilds fish. found, example, larger net typically catches fewer smaller species especially rivers (steeper banks reduce fishing efficiency), yet often returns species per haul given potentially broader habitats can reach. Differences gill nets used sample deeper waters 1970s/80s compared recent periods may also impacted comparability fish data sets. example, gill nets used earlier period combination floating sunken nets, recent sampling periods sunken nets may sampled pelagic species less effectively. Additionally, whereas nets set three hours 1970s–1980s, set one hour recent period given revised regulatory requirements ethical considerations. standardised data sets numbers fish caught per hour, nets left water longer periods simply greater likelihood catching greater number species present.Although data standardization methods can adjust effects net biases abundances fish species caught, impossible adjust abundance species never caught given fish sample. , way knowing whether failure net catch species due net type, species simply present.
